          <h1>1. Understanding the Basics of GST</h1>
          <h3>What is GST?</h3>
          <p>
            GST, or Goods and Services Tax, is a comprehensive indirect tax
            levied on the supply of goods and services in India. It has replaced
            multiple indirect taxes, simplifying the tax structure and creating
            a unified market across the country.
          </p>
          <h3>Benefits of GST for Businesses</h3>
          <p>GST offers numerous advantages for businesses:</p>
          <div className={styles.unordered1}>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simplified tax structure: GST has eliminated the cascading
                effect of multiple taxes, streamlining the taxation process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced compliance burden: With a single tax system, businesses
                now deal with fewer tax filings and regulations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wider market access: GST has removed inter-state tax barriers,
                allowing businesses to expand their operations across India more
                easily.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhanced transparency: The digital GST system promotes
                transparency and reduces tax evasion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Input Tax Credit (ITC): Businesses can claim credit for taxes
                paid on inputs, reducing overall tax liability.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h1>GST Registration</h1>
          <h3>Who Needs to Register for GST?</h3>
          <p>
            GST registration is mandatory for businesses whose aggregate
            turnover exceeds the GST registration turnover limit. As of 2024,
            the thresholds are:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered2}>

              <li>₹40 lakhs for goods suppliers in most states</li>
              <li>
                ₹20 lakhs for services providers and special category states
              </li>
              <li>₹10 lakhs for businesses in North-Eastern and Hill States</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>GST Registration Process</h3>
          <p>
            The GST registration process is primarily online and involves the
            following steps:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered2}>
            <ul>
              <li>Visit the official GST portal (www.gst.gov.in)</li>
              <li>Select "New Registration" under the "Services" section</li>
              <li>
                Fill out the application form (GST REG-01) with business details
              </li>
              <li>Upload required documents</li>
              <li>
                Verify the application using Digital Signature Certificate (DSC)
                or Electronic Verification Code (EVC)
              </li>
              <li>
                Submit the application and receive the Application Reference
                Number (ARN)
              </li>
              <li>Await verification and approval</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>GST Registration Fees and Costs</h3>
          <p>
            The GST registration process itself is free of charge. However,
            businesses may incur costs for professional assistance or GST
            software.
          </p>
          <h1>Key GST Concepts</h1>
          <h3>GST Rates and Slabs</h3>
          <p>GST in India follows a multi-tiered rate structure:</p>
          <div className={styles.unordered2}>
            <ul>
              <li>0% (exempt goods and services)</li>
              <li>5% (essential items)</li>
              <li>12% (standard rate)</li>
              <li>18% (standard rate)</li>
              <li>28% (luxury and sin goods)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            Additionally, there are special rates like 3% for gold and 0.25% for
            rough precious stones
          </p>
          <h3>GST Return Filing</h3>
          <p>
            GST return filing is a crucial compliance requirement. The main
            types of GST returns include:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered2}>
            <ul>
              <li>GSTR-1 (monthly/quarterly outward supplies)</li>
              <li>GSTR-3B (monthly/quarterly summary return)</li>
              <li>GSTR-9 (annual return)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>GST Payment and Due Dates</h3>
          <p>
            GST payments must be made by the 20th of each month for the previous
            month's transactions. The due dates for GST returns vary based on
            the type of return and the taxpayer's category.
          </p>
          <h3>Input Tax Credit (ITC) Mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            The ITC mechanism allows businesses to claim credit for taxes paid
            on inputs, reducing the overall tax burden. This system helps avoid
            cascading taxes and promotes seamless credit flow.
          </p>
          <h3>GST Exemptions and Exceptions</h3>
          <p>
            Certain goods and services are exempt from GST, including basic food
            items, healthcare services, and educational services. It's essential
            for businesses to stay updated on the latest exemptions and
            exceptions.
          </p>
