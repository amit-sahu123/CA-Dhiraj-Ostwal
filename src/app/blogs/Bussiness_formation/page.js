              <h3>Private Limited Company (PLC)</h3>
              <p>
                A Private Limited Company is one of the most popular business
                structures in India, offering limited liability protection to
                its shareholders. The registration of a company as a PLC
                involves several steps:
              </p>
              <div className={styles.unordered1}>
  <ul>
    <li>Obtain Digital Signature Certificates (DSC) for all directors</li>
    <li>Apply for Director Identification Numbers (DIN)</li>
    <li>Reserve a unique company name</li>
    <li>File incorporation documents with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)</li>
    <li>Receive Certificate of Incorporation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

              <p>
                The private limited registration process requires documents such
                as proof of address, identity proof, and photographs of
                directors. This structure is ideal for businesses looking to
                raise capital and scale operations.
              </p>
              <h3>Partnership </h3>
              <p>
                Partnership registration in India is governed by the Indian
                Partnership Act, 1932. To register a partnership:
              </p>
              <div className={styles.unordered1}>
                <ul>
                  <li>Draft a partnership deed </li>
                  <li>Obtain a PAN card for the firm </li>
                  <li>Register with the Registrar of Firms</li>
                  <li>Obtain necessary licenses and registration </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                Partnerships offer flexibility in management but come with
                unlimited liability for partners.
              </p>
              <h3>One Person Company (OPC) </h3>
              <p>
                For solo entrepreneurs wondering how to register an IT company
                in India, the OPC structure might be ideal. The registration
                process for an OPC is similar to that of a PLC, but with a
                single director and shareholder. Key steps include:
              </p>
              <div className={styles.unordered1}>
                <ul>
                  <li>Obtain DSC and DIN</li>
                  <li>Reserve a unique name </li>
                  <li>File incorporation documents</li>

                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                OPCs offer the benefits of limited liability with simplified
                compliance requirements.
              </p>
              <h3> Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</h3>
              <p>
                LLPs are popular among professional service providers due to
                their flexibility and limited liability protection.
              </p>
