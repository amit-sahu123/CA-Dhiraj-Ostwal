The statutory audit meaning encompasses a comprehensive review of a company's financial health, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Understanding "what is statutory audit" is crucial for businesses and stakeholders alike </p>

          <p>The importance of statutory audits lies in their role in maintaining financial integrity, enhancing credibility, and supporting informed decision-making. Unlike internal or voluntary audits, statutory audits are mandated by law and follow specific regulatory guidelines </p>
<h1>Legal Framework for Statutory Audits</h1>
          <p>
          The Chartered Accountant Act provides the foundation for statutory audits in India. This act, along with other regulatory requirements, outlines the scope and responsibilities of statutory auditors. Compliance audit aspects are integral to statutory auditing, ensuring adherence to legal and financial reporting standards
          </p>

         


          <h1>Statutory Auditor</h1>
          <p>
          A statutory auditor must possess specific qualifications, typically being a Chartered Accountant. Their responsibilities include examining financial records, assessing internal controls, and providing an independent opinion on financial statements. The appointment and removal of statutory auditors follow strict procedures to maintain independence and objectivity [4].
          </p>
          <h1>
           Statutory Audit Process
          </h1>
          <p>
          The statutory audit process involves:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered1}>
            <ul>
               <li>Planning: Developing an audit strategy and plan</li>
               <li>Execution: Conducting audit procedures and gathering evidence</li>
               <li>Reporting: Preparing and issuing the audit report</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Each stage requires meticulous attention to detail and adherence to professional standards</p>
          <h1>Financial Statements in Statutory Audits</h1>
          <p>Financial statements are the cornerstone of statutory audits. The financial statements definition encompasses documents that provide a snapshot of a company's financial position. Key components include:</p>
<div className={styles.unordered1}>
    <ul>
        <li>  Balance Sheet</li>
        <li> Income Statement</li>
        <li> Cash Flow Statement</li>
        <li> Statement of Changes in Equity</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Understanding financial statements examples and their limitations is crucial for effective auditing</p>
<h1>Audit Reporting</h1>
<p>The statutory audit report is the culmination of the audit process. It includes:</p>
<div className={styles.unordered1}>
    <ul>
        <li>Auditor's opinion</li>
        <li>Basis for opinion</li>
        <li> Key audit matters</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div className={styles.unordered1}>
    <ul>

        <li>Financial statements of Tata Motors: Demonstrates industry-specific reporting</li>
        <li> Audit report of Infosys: Highlights best practices in audit reporting</li>
    </ul>
</div>

</li>
        <li>Completeness</li>
        <li> Valuation</li>
        <li> Rights and Obligations</li>
    </ul>

<h1>External Audit Considerations</h1>
<p>While statutory audits are a form of external audit, not all external audits are statutory. The external audit vs. statutory audit distinction lies in their mandates and scope. Interestingly, the term "external auditory canal" in anatomy shares the word "auditory" but refers to a part of the ear, highlighting the diverse contexts of audit-related terms</p>
